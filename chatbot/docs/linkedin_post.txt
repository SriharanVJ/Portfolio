🚀 Excited to share my latest project: A Smart RAG-Powered Chatbot! 

I've built an intelligent chatbot that combines the power of Google's Gemini AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to deliver contextually-aware responses using personal documents.

✨ Key Features:
• RAG implementation using FAISS vector database for semantic search
• PDF document processing and chunking for knowledge base
• Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API for natural language understanding
• Sentence Transformers for embedding generation
• FastAPI backend with CORS support
• Text-to-speech integration for audio responses
• Automatic uppercase text normalization
• Exponential backoff retry mechanism for API calls

🛠 Tech Stack:
• Python, FastAPI, FAISS, Sentence Transformers
• Google Gemini API, PyPDF2, NumPy
• Vector embeddings and semantic search

🔧 The system processes documents by:
1. Loading PDF content and splitting into manageable chunks
2. Creating vector embeddings for each chunk
3. Storing embeddings in FAISS index for fast similarity search
4. Retrieving relevant context when answering queries
5. Generating contextual responses through the LLM

This project demonstrates how to build a privacy-conscious, locally-hosted AI assistant that can answer questions based on personal documents while maintaining data security.
